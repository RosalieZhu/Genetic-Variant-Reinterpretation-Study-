# Genetic-Variant-Reinterpretation-Study-
This is a code repository for the ongoing genetic reinterpretation program called Discover, but note that this is just a small part of their study. Our goal is to help the genetic and nongenetic providers' recruitment, and collect information from ethical, legal and economical aspect. MY job is collecting information of genetic and non-genetic providers for them.
